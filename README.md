**chaconnb/chaconnb** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. student @ UT Austin!
- ğŸ¤” My research predominantly revolves around the mitigation of uncertainty in the contexts of exploration and development scenarios, encompassing a wide spectrum of applications within the domains of oil, gas, mining, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about geostatistics, deep learning, and optimization in order to find ways to improve how to characterize the sub-surface. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love nature and hikes!
--> Soy Colombiana!
