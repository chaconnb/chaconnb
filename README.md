### Hola! 👋

🔭 I’m currently a Ph.D. student @ UT Austin!
🤔 My research predominantly revolves around the mitigation of uncertainty in the contexts of exploration and development scenarios, encompassing a wide spectrum of applications within the domains of oil, gas, mining, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).
🌱 I’m currently learning about geostatistics, deep learning, and optimization in order to find ways to improve how to characterize the sub-surface. 
⚡ Fun fact: I love nature and hikes!
Soy Colombiana!
